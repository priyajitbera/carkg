                "A \"Brand Name\" of a car brand is the specific name a company uses to market and sell its cars, such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, Toyota, Honda, Ford, or Volkswagen. These names identify the manufacturer and often have origins in the founders' names (like Toyota) or historical figures (like Cadillac).";

                "A car brand's country of origin is the country where the brand was founded and historically developed. For example, Toyota is a Japanese brand, Volkswagen is German, and Ford is American, according to various sources on car brands and manufacturers. While manufacturing may occur in other countries, the \"country of origin\" refers to the brand's original national roots.";
